Installation

  To install, simply copy the RecipeExport folder into your _classic_/interface/AddOns folder.

Exporting your Recipes
  Open up the window of the profession you want to export the recipes for (the one that lists the recipes) and run /exr.
  A popup will appear that contains "!recipeadd" followed by your recipes of that profession, copy it, paste it into the discord 
  RecipeTracker channel and send the message. Your Recipes for that Profession are now added to the RecipeTracker. (Due to discords maximum   message size, there may be several popups to ensure each command is small enough to fit into a discord message)
  
Exporting Enchanting Recipes
  Enchanting is a special case and will only be exported if no other profession window was opened since the last reload.
  So, to export your enchanting Recipes, use /reload then open the enchanting window and use /exr.
