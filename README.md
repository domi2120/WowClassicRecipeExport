Exporting your Recipes
  Open up the window of the profession you want to export the recipes for (the one that lists the recipes) and run /exr.
  The Chat will now contain a "!recipeadd" followed by your recipes of that profession, copy it, paste it into the discord 
  RecipeTracker channel and send the message. Your Recipes for that Profession are now added to the RecipeTracker.
  
Exporting Enchanting Recipes
  Enchanting is a special case and will only be exported if no other profession window was opened since the last reload.
  So, to export your enchanting Recipes, use /reload then open the enchanting window and use /exr.
